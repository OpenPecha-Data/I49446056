Benedictory Verses[1]

by Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö

Oṃ svasti.This razor that severs the tongues of those whose discourse is unsound,Who are as
if infected by jungpo demons, and whose meagre intellectsCannot comprehend the peerless tradition
of the Jonangpas,Which skilfully reveals the ultimate,[2] natural state of the Middle
Way,This excellent explanation by Dodrup Tenpai Nyima,Has now been printed as a gift of
DharmaUnder the auspices of Gerab Nyerchen Sokmo.Through this, may all set out upon the
genuine path.Sarva maṅgalam.
