Benedictory Verses for the Summary of the Perfection of Wisdom

by Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö

Oṃ svasti.May this precious essence of the long, medium and shortDharma scriptures expressing
Transcendent Wisdom,The Mother who bears all the victors and their heirs,A wish-fulfilling
jewel-like summary, magically printed,Bring many hundred signs of auspiciousness and virtueAnd
vajra-like victory in the battle with adversity.And through the power of this positive
deed,Undertaken with such faith and diligence,May we swiftly attain the level of omniscience.


These words for the printer’s colophon were offered as a prayer of aspiration by Chökyi Lodrö.
Siddhir-bhavatu! Maṅgalam.
